# Optimizing Email Campaign Click-Through Rates: A/B Test Analysis of Subject Line Personalization

## Overview

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test conducted to determine the optimal level of subject line personalization for email marketing campaigns.  The analysis focuses on maximizing click-through rates (CTR) and ultimately increasing user engagement.  The project utilizes statistical methods to compare the performance of different personalization strategies and provides actionable insights for improving future email campaigns.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* SciPy (optional, depending on statistical tests used)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the A/B test results to the console, including key statistics such as click-through rates for each variation and the statistical significance of the differences.  Additionally, the script will generate visualizations (e.g., bar charts comparing CTRs, potentially boxplots showing the distribution of click rates) and save them as PNG files in the `output` directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist).  These visualizations aid in understanding the impact of different personalization levels on campaign performance.  The specific output may vary depending on the data and the statistical tests used.


## Data

The project requires a data file named `email_campaign_data.csv` (or adjust the file name in `main.py`) located in the same directory as the script. This CSV file should contain columns representing at least:

* `subject_line_variation`:  Indicates the level of personalization (e.g., "No Personalization", "First Name Only", "First and Last Name").
* `clicks`: Number of clicks received for that subject line variation.
* `opens`: Number of opens received for that subject line variation.
